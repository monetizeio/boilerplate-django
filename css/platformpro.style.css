CUSTOMIZATION NOTE - Customization CSS in PageLines Themes
	- Customize PageLines themes by adding CSS in the theme settings or in a child theme. 
	- Don't add it here; as it will either get overwritten by updates, or prevent you from updating at all
	- (Trust us on this one!)
	
Why isn't the CSS in this file? 
Two reasons: First, to seperate the theme description information and it's formatting. Second, to prevent people from editing this file from the WordPress Admin only to find out later that those edits prevent them from upgrading.
