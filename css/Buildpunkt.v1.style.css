  Description: Platform Base is a Platform child theme (a WordPress child

    **IMPORTANT** For this to work PlatformPro must be called 'platformpro'
    (lowercase) in your themes folder.

 IMPORTANT: The files below need to find the actual directory of Platform. If
            the PlatformPro is named something other than 'platformpro' you
            will need to change that value below.

 ON UPDATING: Base shouldn't be replaced in your install with every release.
              It defeats the purpose of using a child theme. Use updates to
              this Platform Child Theme, as a reference to help you improve
              your own customizations.
