  This template is a reusable HTML5 form generator. It may be included from
  any template which requires an HTML5 form, and communicates with the parent
  template by means of the available context. To use this template, make sure
  that the context variable ‘form’ points to an instance of (a subtype of)
  django.forms.Form, and that both ‘form_action’ and ‘form_method’ are set.
  These are the only required context variable, the others (explained below)
  are optional.

  form
    Required. An instance of django.forms.Form, the form to render for the
    user.

  form_action
    Required. The relative or absolute URL that the contents of the form will
    be sent to upon submission.

  form_method
    Required. The method of submission of the form (GET or POST).

  form_id
    The #id to be given to the form. If no form_id is specified, one will be
    auto-generated.

  form_class
    The .class or classes to be given to the form, for styling purposes. May
    be empty or undefined, in which case no extra classes are applied.

  form_success_messages
    Messages to be presented to the user in the form header, with a green
    background. Usually an indication of successful submission of the form.

  form_error_messages
    Messages to be presented to the user in the form header, with a red
    background. Usually used to report an error in submission. The Django form
    object also may contain some error messages (the “non-field errors”),
    which will be printed after any messages contained in form_error_messages.
    Field validation errors are captured by the Django form object and will be
    also be reported, albeit in-line next to the offending field.

  form_notice_messages
    Messages to be presented to the user in the form header, with a yellow
    background.

  form_info_messages
    Messages to be presented to the user in the form header, with a blue
    background.

  form_submit_text
    The text to put on the submit button.
