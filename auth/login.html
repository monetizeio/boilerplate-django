{% comment %} auth/login.html ---------------------------------------------===
  It's your responsibility to provide the login form in a template called
  registration/login.html by default. This template gets passed four template
  context variables:

    form
      A Form object representing the login form. See the forms documentation
      for more on Form objects.

    next
      The URL to redirect to after successful login. This may contain a query
      string, too.

    site
      The current Site, according to the SITE_ID setting. If you don't have
      the site framework installed, this will be set to an instance of
      RequestSite, which derives the site name and domain from the current
      HttpRequest.

    site_name
      An alias for site.name. If you don't have the site framework installed,
      this will be set to the value of request.META['SERVER_NAME']. For more
      on sites, see the “contrib.sites” framework.
